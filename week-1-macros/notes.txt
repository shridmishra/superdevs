agar function use karna hai toh mere traits accepts kar warna no --> trait bounds

impl shape means "main jaisa hoon waisa toh ise hona hi padega , baaki extra bhi chalega;

yeh sab isiliye taaki strictness aaye code mein kam errors rahe.

println -> consider it as a function so if you want to use it , u have to use its trait ie display but its hard to 
            implement the trait. so derive macros comes in picture.

derive impls trait?

debug macro imlps debug trait when derive is called

function mein certain types , and definite things pass kar sakte ho, but in macros you can pass anything as much.

#procedural
custom derive -> for deriving macro with traits.

attribute-> for not derive just adding a attribute 

function -> gives contol over input to devs

#declrative
prinln type simple give input get output
